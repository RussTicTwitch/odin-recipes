practice project - odin recipe page
I used this project to practice utilizing different elements of HTML.
The index.html file contains a heading and unordered list of links to other files. Each of the files is a page dedicated to a specific recipe. I added images, ordered and unordered lists, headings, titles, and paragraphs.
